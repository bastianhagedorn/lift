How to â€¦
========


Read me first
-------------

These guides try to clarify how and where things are done in Lift, what files
you have to modify if you want to extend the language, what class needs to be
extended, etc.

At each step during this process, you **should** look at the existing stuff,
find some code which looks close to what you want to implement and take this as
a starting point.

Good luck ;)
